## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r library}
library(caret)
```


```{r get data}
raw_training<-read.csv('https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv',na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!", ""))
raw_testing<-read.csv('https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv',na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!", ""))
train<-raw_training[,colSums(is.na(raw_training)) == 0]
test <-raw_testing[,colSums(is.na(raw_testing)) == 0]


```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r dataset}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
